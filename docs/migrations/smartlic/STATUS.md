## Why not READY_FOR_CUTOVER

Eleven CONFENGE destinations are live, indexable, and brand-clean. The SmartLic bridge config is deploy-ready on `chore/redirect-bridge-2115`. Live apply still needs `$BRIDGE_PUBLIC_IPV4`, ACME email, and a named Cloudflare operator. www TLS is currently a SAN mismatch on Railway. Observation cannot start without a production 301.

## Why not HOLD / NO_GO

The execute set of 11 URL-specific 301s is decided and tested. Unready equivalents are fail-closed HOLD, not weak substitutes. Nothing here restores SmartLic as a product.

## Integration order

1. Land web-cfg pin (this inventory hash) on `feat/smartlic-equity-migration-62`.
2. SmartLic vendors the same bytes and re-pins `bridge/pins.py`.
3. Human accepts the 11-row execute set.
4. Owner applies DNS/TLS using `SmartLic/bridge/docs/CUTOVER.md` — not from this checkout.
5. 28-day observation. Then #2111 archive gate. Do not close #62/#2115 before that.
